The goal of this project is to:
1. find or make an offline version of the ESV bible in a database or json file(based on the needs of other goals) 
2. accept input of book, chapter, verse combinations. 
3. output text that is formated for Open Office Present 

Reason:
I need to automate my work flow for creating the presintation for our church on Sunday mornings.
