#he goal of this project is to:
1. find or make an offline version of the ESV bible in a database or json file(based on the needs of other goals) 
2. accept input of book, chapter, verse combinations. 
3. output text that is formated for Open Office Present 

Reason:
I need to automate my work flow for creating the presintation for our church on Sunday mornings. 

External Tools:
Because licence issues confuse me, and I am sticking with MIT license for this project, I am not intergrating other projects dirrectly into this repo. I am choosing to export data from other tools and then import that data into this project. 

python-bible:
Using the tool python-bible, https://github.com/bengjerstad/python-bible, I extracted the data from data.pt into 2 json files. 

biblegatewayPyAPI:
Using the tool biblegatewayPyAPI, https://github.com/bengjerstad/biblegatewayPyAPI, I was able to extract the ESV bible from Biblegateway. Due to the copywrite on the ESV bible, I won't be able to post the databse file that I created here.
